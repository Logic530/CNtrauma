        <source>In the late 20th century, it was discovered that under the icy, irradiated surface of Jupiter's moon Europa lies a vast sea capable of sustaining life. This discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific community.\n\nIn the year 2022, the first manned space flight arrived on Europa to discover that the moon was indeed already sustaining life, in the form of hostile sub-aquatic fauna. Besides the wildlife, the researchers faced gruelling difficulties posed by the dangerous radiation emitted from Jupiter and the intense cold and tremendous pressure of the Europan ocean.\n\nDespite all their hardships, Earth-born colonists were able to construct a handful of habitable outposts where a new way of life developed over many decades. A new system of governance was formed by a coalition of the largest, most influential cities on the moon. Different industries made their mark in the new world, including mining, manufacturing and chemical laboratories.\n\nOver the years, Europan society became more and more dissociated from Earth. Fifty years ago, contact was lost entirely, and no more supply ships have arrived since.\n\nSub-aquatic travel and vehicles are in a key role in this new society, scouting for new inhabitable locations, protecting citizens from creature attacks and establishing supply lines between stations as humanity ventures ever deeper to evade the lethal radiation from Jupiter above.

        <target>In the late 20th century, it was discovered that under the icy, irradiated surface of Jupiter's moon Europa lies a vast sea capable of sustaining life. This discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific community.\n\nIn the year 2022, the first manned space flight arrived on Europa to discover that the moon was indeed already sustaining life, in the form of hostile sub-aquatic fauna. Besides the wildlife, the researchers faced gruelling difficulties posed by the dangerous radiation emitted from Jupiter and the intense cold and tremendous pressure of the Europan ocean.\n\nDespite all their hardships, Earth-born colonists were able to construct a handful of habitable outposts where a new way of life developed over many decades. A new system of governance was formed by a coalition of the largest, most influential cities on the moon. Different industries made their mark in the new world, including mining, manufacturing and chemical laboratories.\n\nOver the years, Europan society became more and more dissociated from Earth.

        <source>Officer Pérez's Safe and Sound Security 101\n\nHostile factions and individuals are known to offer submariners bribes or other compensation for committing unlawful acts. This is unfortunately so common that throwing every traitorous submariner out the airlock would be detrimental to the submarine fleets and the Europan labor force as a whole. The Code of Fair Disciplinary Actions provides guidelines for dealing with traitors or other troublesome crewmates in a just manner.\n\nLevel 1 Offenses:\nDescription: mostly harmless misdemeanors, "pranks," neglect of assigned duties. Acts that at most cause minor inconvenience to the rest of the crew.\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Notify the person of their misconduct and command them back to their duties. A baton or some other non-lethal tool may be used to accentuate the verbal commands. More severe disciplinary actions can be considered if the misconduct continues.\n\nLevel 2 Offenses:\nDescription: acts that may endanger the health of the crew or submarine, such as intentional mishandling of devices or substances.\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Similar to level 1 offenses, a simple disciplining can suffice, but depending on the misconduct security can deem it necessary to instead handcuff or detain the individual by other means\n\nLevel 3 Offenses:\nDescription: clearly hostile acts with the intention to cause severe injuries or the death of one or more crewmates.\nSuggested disciplinary actions: Disposing of the traitor as soon as possible is advised. The disposal should preferably be carried out in a humane way, but it is understandable if such means are not available or feasible for one reason or another.</source>

They pump air through ventilation to different rooms and can be used to refill oxygen tanks.\n\nTo refill oxygen tanks, interact ([InteractType.Use]) with the generator to open its inventory. Insert an empty oxygen tank into one of the slots to start refilling it. When the tank is full, drag it back to your inventory or into your diving suit/mask.</target>
