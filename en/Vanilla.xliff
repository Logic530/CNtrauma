<target>\nDay 1 of the expedition out of Meltwater.

If a line cook at Irma Burger is found dead, it's probably a crime of passion, an argument gone wrong,” they explain. “The killer may be found, justice dispensed.” They take a look around. Nobody seems to be listening, but the guard continues in whisper: “A reporter is found in the trash, their ID scratched out? You turn a blind eye. There's nothing good to be found in that rabbit hole.”</target>

Different industries made their mark in the new world, including mining, manufacturing and chemical laboratories.\n\nOver the years, Europan society became more and more dissociated from Earth. Fifty years ago, contact was lost entirely, and no more supply ships have arrived since.\n\nSub-aquatic travel and vehicles are in a key role in this new society, scouting for new inhabitable locations, protecting citizens from creature attacks and establishing supply lines between stations as humanity ventures ever deeper to evade the lethal radiation from Jupiter above. The life of a crewmember aboard one of these submarines is a lucrative one, albeit dangerous and often short.\n\nYou have enlisted to serve on a yyyy-class submarine, docked at xxxx. The waters of Europa open up before you—explore, help expand the colonies, and make of this place what you will.</target>
