        <source>In the late 20th century, it was discovered that under the icy, irradiated surface of Jupiter's moon Europa lies a vast sea capable of sustaining life. This discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific community.\n\nIn the year 2022, the first manned space flight arrived on Europa to discover that the moon was indeed already sustaining life, in the form of hostile sub-aquatic fauna. Besides the wildlife, the researchers faced gruelling difficulties posed by the dangerous radiation emitted from Jupiter and the intense cold and tremendous pressure of the Europan ocean.\n\nDespite all their hardships, Earth-born colonists were able to construct a handful of habitable outposts where a new way of life developed over many decades.
