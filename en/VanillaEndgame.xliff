        <source>The Eye of Europa, and the strange gravitational phenomenon around it, has puzzled scientists ever since it's discovery by the first unmanned missions to Europa. Conveniently for Europan colonists, the gravity around the Eye is close to that of Earth's, instead of the normal 0.13 G surface gravity elsewhere on the moon.</source>

        <source>Captain's log, part 1\n\nIt is not in my nature to write in detail about unremarkable things. I've felt that keeping a log of conditions as unchanging as these icy waters is as beneficial as dumping a bucketful of boiling water in an attempt to warm them. But to my regret I see now that I've shirked my duties by not keeping a diary. This is my attempt at rectifying that mistake. What I've seen in my last days here must be recorded somewhere, even if here at the end of space it's too late for the reader. I will ask you to bear with me, because for my story to make sense, I need to start at the beginning.\n\nSince I was a young kid, something drew me towards the Eye at the center of Europa. That might seem a somewhat obvious remark, on account of the gravity anomaly that has been well observed by individuals much more intelligent than I, but I assure you that my attraction runs much deeper. At night I would often dream of peeling off the skin of a raptorbane, only to find a monstrous fiery eye staring back at me, lidless and unmoving. I would wake at my desk, looking at drawn images of concentric circles, and I could not remember drawing them.\n\nIn hopes of sating my curiosity and curing my incipient parasomnia, I hopped the first scout ship to the center.</source>

        <source>Captain's log, part 2\n\nOn my first voyage I served as assistant. For a week, to be exact. The ship's mechanic succumbed to a parasite, effecting me being promoted to take his place. I learned the craft over months, slaving in the hot engine room. Perhaps it was the physical exertion or the fact that I was slowly but surely nearing the Eye, but my nights were peaceful and without nightmares. That changed when one night the ship was attacked and left wrecked and immobile. I, along with some other survivors were rescued by another passing ship and left at the nearest station. Not long after, nightmares returned.\n\nIt became clear to me that I had no choice but to keep heading for the Eye. But due to the location of the station, being in the frontier, few ships had any reason to be travelling deeper. To keep myself occupied while waiting for the opportunity, I worked as a shipwright. Days came and went, but no submarine crews were heading to the center.\n\nAfter a few years of toiling and restless nights I found myself with a sizeable nest egg. Enough to buy my own submarine. If no opportunity presented itself to me, I'd make my own, I thought.</source>

        <source>Captain's log, part 3\n\nIt took some effort to hire a crew, but a promise of money will rouse the right type of seafarer. With a crew of six in a freshly refitted Coalition patrol sub, I was finally the captain of my own vessel, and in control of my own fate. I sailed from Sermilik shipyard. It would be the last time I'd see civilization.\n\nThe journey was unsurprisingly fraught with danger and the ship endured challenges both expected and unexpected. From creatures unseen in the more civilized Europa to hostile environmental features; undersea volcanoes and flora that assaults the ship from inside. Not all risk came from outside, either. The physical and psychological stress took its toll on everyone, and regrettably some of us were not as strong as others.\n\nI will not spend more time expanding on the obstacles, for whoever finds this log surely has faced the same. Suffice it to say, after a lengthy voyage, banged up and battle-worn the ship and its passengers reached the Eye. Like the eye from my dreams, it swallowed me whole in a fiery inferno.</source>

        <source>In the early 21st century, it was discovered that under the icy, irradiated surface of Jupiter's moon Europa lies a vast sea sustaining microbial life.\n\nFollowing the discovery, it didn't take long for the first manned space flight to arrive on Europa and verify the sea did not only host microbial life, but complex, hostile sub-aquatic fauna. Besides the wildlife, the researchers faced gruelling difficulties posed by the dangerous radiation emitted from Jupiter and the intense cold and tremendous pressure of the Europan ocean.</source>
