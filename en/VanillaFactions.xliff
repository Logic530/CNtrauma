What is the heaviest thing? asketh the spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.\n\nIs it not this: To descend to the deepest depths to tempt the temper?\n\nOr is it this: To feed on the fruit of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?\n\nOr is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and not disclaim the pests and parasites within it?\n\nOr is it this: To love those who despise us, and to give one's hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us?\n\nAll these heaviest things the spirit taketh upon itself: and as a chalice in the shape of a man’s fortitude, it rejoiceth in its strength.\n\nBut then riseth a miasma from the chalice, for the man’s fortitude carrieth burdens of old, now stale and foul.\n\nThus speaketh the miasma to the spirit, "Thou shalt!"\n\nThe ideas and values of thousands of years in the air reeketh.

To create new values—that, a mere man cannot accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the fortitude of man do.\n\nTo create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty and humanity: for that, my brethren, there is no need of the man. To assume the ride into new values—that is the most formidable assumption for a reverent spirit.\n\nBut tell me, my brethren, what is the value of an empty chalice? For is it not the wine that gives it purpose?

A fortitude readily within the grasp of those who dare to reach out, as if a Gift the world has handed us.\n\nThus comes the third and final metamorphosis, the Ascension: the man’s spirit filled with new life, the fortitude of man and the fortitude of the world as one. Its own will, willeth now the spirit; his own world winneth the world's outcast. Thus is the quintessential form.</source>
