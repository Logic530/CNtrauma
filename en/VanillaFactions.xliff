As is the Blankest of Slates, so is the mind of the Jester. They see the mind of the people as their own mind. To those who are good they treat as good. To those who aren't good they also treat as good. They trust people who are trustworthy. They also trust people who aren't trustworthy. Thus they attain goodness and trust, lest the manure-minded serious people stop the stream of Fun.</source>

        <source>VII. If you do not fear death, how can it intimidate you? To truly understand this is to take a great stride along the Path of the Bike Horn. To unnaturally try to extend life is to fear death. To try and alter the life-breath is to fear death. The Jester understands that when something reaches its prime it will soon begin to decline. Changing the natural is to stray from the Path of the Bike Horn. Those who do it will not have Fun in the end.\n\nVIII. With compassion, you will be able to be brave. With moderation, you will be able to bring Fun to the world. With humility, you will be able to guide others. To abandon compassion while seeking to be brave, or abandoning moderation while being amusing, or abandoning humility while seeking to guide will not lead to Fun.\n\nIX. The kite rises high and the Jester lets it soar; the kite string pops and the Jester lets it fly away. He has but does not possess, acts but does not expect. When his work is done, he forgets it. That is why it lasts forever, much like the Grandest of Jesters. Praise the Honkmother!</source>

        <source>Three metamorphoses of the spirit do I designate to you: how the spirit becometh a chalice in the shape of a man’s fortitude, the chalice emptieth of the stale wine, and the chalice refilleth with fresh wine.\n\nMany things are there for the spirit to carry, the strong spirit in which the reverence dwelleth.\n\nWhat is there to carry? so asketh the spirit, holding out its hands. What is the heaviest thing? asketh the spirit, that I may take it upon me and rejoice in my strength.\n\nIs it not this: To descend to the deepest depths to tempt the temper?\n\nOr is it this: To feed on the fruit of knowledge, and for the sake of truth to suffer hunger of soul?\n\nOr is it this: To go into foul water when it is the water of truth, and not disclaim the pests and parasites within it?\n\nOr is it this: To love those who despise us, and to give one's hand to the phantom when it is going to frighten us?\n\nAll these heaviest things the spirit taketh upon itself: and as a chalice in the shape of a man’s fortitude, it rejoiceth in its strength.\n\nBut then riseth a miasma from the chalice, for the man’s fortitude carrieth burdens of old, now stale and foul.\n\nThus speaketh the miasma to the spirit, "Thou shalt!"\n\nThe ideas and values of thousands of years in the air reeketh. "All the values of things embalming me. All values have already been created, and all created values—do I represent. Verily, there shall be no 'I will' any more." Thus speaketh the miasma.\n\nMy brethren, wherefore is there need of emptying the chalice? Why sufficeth not the fortitude of man, which renounceth and is reverent? To create new values—that, a mere man cannot accomplish: but to create itself freedom for new creating—that can the fortitude of man do.\n\nTo create itself freedom, and give a holy Nay even unto duty and humanity: for that, my brethren, there is no need of the man. To assume the ride into new values—that is the most formidable assumption for a reverent spirit.\n\nBut tell me, my brethren, what is the value of an empty chalice? For is it not the wine that gives it purpose? Thus must we find a new wine, fresh and untainted, beyond the fortitude of man, yet within its grasp.\n\nAye, for the game of creating, my brethren, there is needed a holy Yea unto life, the fortitude of life itself. A fortitude readily within the grasp of those who dare to reach out, as if a Gift the world has handed us.\n\nThus comes the third and final metamorphosis, the Ascension: the man’s spirit filled with new life, the fortitude of man and the fortitude of the world as one. Its own will, willeth now the spirit; his own world winneth the world's outcast. Thus is the quintessential form.</source>
